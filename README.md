# 📘 LeetCode Progress Tracker — Stan Lee

This repository tracks my **LeetCode problem-solving journey**, serving as a personal log of solutions, consistency, and improvement over time.

I use this repo primarily for:

* Maintaining daily/weekly LeetCode momentum
* Reviewing past solutions and patterns
* Preparing for technical interviews
* Tracking long-term consistency rather than just problem count

---

## 🔄 Progress Sync Method

My LeetCode activity is automatically synced using the following Chrome extension:
